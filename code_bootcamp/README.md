prob_1.py contains code which randomly generates an adjacency matrix corresponding to a graph along with its node degrees.

prob_2.py contains code for a fun Factor Game; a two-player game where the current player picks a number to add to their score, making it unavailable. The opponent then gains all available factors of that number, which are also marked unavailable.
